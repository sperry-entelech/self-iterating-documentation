# Cursor Rules - Bug Fixing Standard Operating Procedure

## CRITICAL: Bug Fixing Protocol

When fixing a bug, you MUST follow this exact sequence:

1. **Identify the root cause**
   - Analyze the error message, stack trace, and related code
   - Trace the issue to its source
   - Understand why the bug exists, not just what's broken

2. **Implement the fix**
   - Make the minimal necessary changes to resolve the root cause
   - Ensure the fix addresses the underlying issue, not just symptoms
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions

3. **Verify with linting**
   - Run linter checks on modified files
   - Fix any linting errors or warnings
   - Ensure code quality standards are met

4. **End with summary**
   - ALWAYS end your response with a simple one-sentence summary
   - Use exactly 3 alarm emojis (🚨🚨🚨)
   - This summary must be the very last sentence in your response
   - Format: `🚨🚨🚨 [One sentence describing what was fixed]`

## Example

```
Root cause: The API endpoint was only returning partial metadata, missing GitHub info.

Fix: Updated the SQL query to select full metadata field and parse it properly, including GitHub publish information in the response.

Linting: ✅ No errors

🚨🚨🚨 Fixed skills library viewing by updating backend to return full metadata with GitHub info and adding type aliases for frontend compatibility.
```

## Additional Guidelines

- Always check for existing similar fixes before implementing
- Test the fix in context, not just in isolation
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Document non-obvious fixes with comments
- Update related tests if they exist
